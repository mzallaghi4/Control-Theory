## Reinforcement Learning for Control
This section provides an overview of Reinforcement Learning for Control, a field that focuses on using reinforcement learning algorithms to solve optimal control problems. 
### Basics of Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-driven Machine Learning method that focuses on training agents to make optimal decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. 
The agent learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of RL is to find a balance between exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known actions that yield the best rewards).
### Reinforcement Learning Formulations and Approaches
Reinforcement learning problems can be formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs), which provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems with stochastic outcomes and controllable actions. 
There are two main approaches to solving RL problems: model-free and model-based methods.
#### Model-Free RL Framework
In the model-free RL framework, the agent learns a policy (a mapping from states to actions) or a value function (a mapping from states to expected rewards) directly from its interactions with the environment without relying on a model of the environment's dynamics.
#### Model-Based RL Framework
In the model-based RL framework, the agent first learns a model of the environment's dynamics and then uses this model to plan and make decisions. This approach can be more sample-efficient than model-free methods but may require more computational resources.
### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a subfield of RL that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning algorithms. DRL algorithms use deep neural networks to represent the policy or value function, allowing them to handle high-dimensional state spaces and complex environments.
